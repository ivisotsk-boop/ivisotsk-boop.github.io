        My name is Ivan Visotsky and I am a junior undergraduate student at the
        University of North Carolina at Charlotte. This is my personal home page
        that I created as part of the ITIS-3135 course better known as Front End
        Web App Development. I was born in Michigan to a family of immigrants
        from Estonia. I learned Russian as my first language and was raised with
        Russian traditions. My family decided to move to Charlotte in 2013 due
        to the large Russian speaking population and better opportunities.

        The first time I showed interest in computers was when I would take
        apart old motherboards from PCs and pull all of the tiny pieces apart. I
        would wonder what all of the tiny capacitors and circuits were meant to
        do. Then, after years of not pursuing this interest I started learning
        about cyber security at the Central Academy of Technology and Arts in
        Monroe, NC. This was where I realized that I would work in the IT
        industry. Now I am studying Computer Science at UNCC and am excited to
        learn as much as I can about programming and software development.
