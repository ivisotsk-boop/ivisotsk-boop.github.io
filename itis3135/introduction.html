        <p class="paragraph">My name is Ivan Visotsky and I am a junior undergraduate student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
            This is my personal home page that I created as part of the ITIS-3135 course better known as Front End Web App Development.
            I was born in Michigan to a family of immigrants from Estonia. I learned Russian as my first language and was raised
            with Russian traditions. My family decided to move to Charlotte in 2013 due to the large Russian speaking population and better
            opportunities. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">The first time I showed interest in computers was when I would take apart old motherboards from PCs and pull all of 
            the tiny pieces apart. I would wonder what all of the tiny capacitors and circuits were 
            meant to do. Then, after years of not pursuing this interest I started learning about cyber security at
            the Central Academy of Technology and Arts in Monroe, NC. This was where I realized that I would work in the IT industry.
            Now I am studying Computer Science at UNCC and am excited to learn as much as I can about programming and software development.
